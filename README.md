All results are reproducable. And all experiments data and models are available through links and git.

By creating a shotcut to the shared files in your Google Drive root dictionary, you can run the code through colab without future modification. 

If you want to run it locally, please change the valuable "data_base" in Cell Experiment and the path to open dataset at the first Cell to your path.
